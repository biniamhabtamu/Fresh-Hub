    "question": "The Dalai Lama argues that China has no business in Tibet and that the West should do something about it. But the Dalai Lama just wants the Chinese to leave so he can return as leader. Naturally he argues this way. Therefore, we should reject his arguments. The fallacy committed in this argument is:",
    "options": [
      "A. Appeal to people",
      "B. Straw man",
      "C. Ad hominem circumstantial",
      "D. Ad hominem Tu quoque"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This fallacy occurs when an arguer attempts to discredit an opponent's argument by suggesting that the opponent's circumstances or vested interests motivate their claim, rather than the claim's actual merit. The arguer here rejects the Dalai Lama's argument not based on its substance, but because he has a personal motive (returning as leader).",

    "question": "Occurs when the arguer distorts his/her opponent's argument or position to make it appear weaker than it really is.",
    "options": [
      "A. Fallacy of missing the point",
      "B. Straw man fallacy",
      "C. Fallacy of accident",
      "D. Fallacy of red herring"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The straw man fallacy involves misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack. Instead of refuting the actual argument, the arguer refutes a distorted or oversimplified version of it, which is the 'straw man.'",

      "B. Appeal to the people, bandwagon",
      "C. Appeal to the people, indirect approach",
      "D. Appeal to the people, Snobbery",
      "E. Appeal to the people, Vanity"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The appeal to the people (ad populum) direct approach occurs when an arguer attempts to arouse a mob mentality or a sense of crowd excitement to win acceptance of a conclusion. Hitler's speech is a classic example of this, as he directly addresses a large group to stir up emotions and bypass rational thought.",

      "E. None of the above"

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This definition precisely describes the straw man fallacy. The arguer creates a distorted version of the opponent's argument (the 'straw man') and attacks that instead of the real argument.",

      "E. Appeal to people"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The fallacy of accident occurs when a general rule is applied to a specific case it was not intended to cover. The general rule that 'good students obey their teachers' is misapplied to an exceptional case where obedience would be immoral or harmful.",

      "D. Snobbery",
      "E. Accident"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This argument is based on suppressed evidence. The arguer ignores or omits crucial information needed to make a sound judgment. The hospital's quality is not determined by its appearance but by factors like medical expertise, equipment, and patient care. By focusing on irrelevant visual attributes, the arguer suppresses the real evidence.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' fallacy, or 'after this, therefore because of this,' assumes that because one event happened after another, the first event must have caused the second. This fallacy confuses temporal succession with causal connection.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The bandwagon fallacy is a type of appeal to the people that argues something must be true or good because 'everyone is doing it' or 'everyone believes it.' The argument suggests the novel is good because it's popular and everyone is talking about it.",

    "question": "Since time immemorial, every culture and society has believed in the existence of our great God, using different names but signifying the one, true deity nevertheless. Hence, given this universal consent of mankind, only a deluded fool and stubborn sinner would claim that there is no God. This expression commits a fallacy of:",

      "D. Argument against the person",
      "E. None of the above"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is another example of the bandwagon fallacy. It claims that a conclusion (the existence of God) is true because it is widely believed ('universal consent of mankind'). The argument also uses emotionally charged language ('deluded fool and stubborn sinner') to pressure the listener into accepting the conclusion.",

Accordingly, all politicians embezzled the public money and hide in foreign banks. The fallacy committed in this argument is:",
    "options": ["A. Weak analogy", "B. Division", "C. Hasty generalization", "D. Composition"],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This argument draws a broad conclusion about all politicians based on a very small and likely unrepresentative sample of three. A hasty generalization occurs when a conclusion is reached from too few examples.",

    "options": ["A. Hasty generalization", "B. Slippery slope fallacy", "C. Over simplified cause fallacy", "D. Weak analogy"],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A weak analogy fallacy occurs when an argument relies on a comparison between two things that are not sufficiently similar in a relevant way. The similarities in color, size, and speed do not provide strong evidence that the cars were made in the same factory.",

    "options": ["A. Slippery slope fallacy", "B. Post hoc fallacy", "C. Non causa pro causa fallacy", "D. Over simplified cause fallacy"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The full name is post hoc ergo propter hoc, meaning \"after this, therefore because of this.\" This fallacy assumes that because one event (the grandfather's death) followed another (the black cat crossing the way), the first event must have caused the second, which is a false causal connection.",

    "question": "The seriousness of a penalty should be comparable to the seriousness of the crime. Right now, the penalty for drunk driving may simply be a fine. But drunk driving is a serious crime that can kill innocent people. Therefore, death penalty should be given for drunk driving. The type of fallacy committed in this argument is:",
    "options": ["A. Missing the point fallacy", "B. Red herring fallacy", "C. Straw man fallacy", "D. Hasty generalization"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This fallacy, also known as ignoratio elenchi, occurs when an arguer presents premises that are logically relevant to one conclusion but then draws a different, unrelated conclusion. The argument correctly points out the seriousness of drunk driving, but the conclusion about the death penalty is an extreme and unrelated point.",

    "id": "log-2013_2017-5-15",
    "question": "No one has ever experienced revelation as source of knowledge. Therefore, it is impossible to access knowledge through revelation. The fallacy committed in the above argument is:",
    "options": ["A. Hasty generalization", "B. Weak analogy", "C. Appeal to ignorance", "D. Slippery slope"],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The appeal to ignorance fallacy (argumentum ad ignorantiam) argues that a proposition is true simply because it has not been proven false, or false because it has not been proven true. The argument concludes that knowledge through revelation is impossible because there is no known evidence of it.",

    "question": "Baye, one of your friends was asking about you the other day. He wanted to know if you were still stealing money from your father. What should I tell him the next time I see him? Are you still doing it? The type of fallacy committed in this argument is:",
    "options": ["A. Begging the question", "B. Straw man", "C. Appeal to force", "D. Complex question"],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A complex question (or loaded question) is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption. The question \"Are you still stealing money from your father?\" presupposes that the person has stolen money in the past, making it a trap regardless of how the person answers.",

    "id": "log-2013_2017-5-17",
    "question": "The government has no right to spy on its citizens because citizens have a right to privacy. And this is true because such a right is guaranteed by the constitution which follows from the fact that our founding fathers recognized the sanctity of individual privacy against the intrusive power of the government. And of course this is true because the government has no right to spy on its citizens. This argument commits the fallacy of:",
    "options": ["A. Begging the question", "B. Red herring", "C. Slippery slope", "D. Missing the point"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This argument is a prime example of begging the question or circular reasoning. It uses the conclusion (\"the government has no right to spy on its citizens\") as a premise to support itself, offering no independent evidence.",

    "question": "The president of college \"X\" has promised to stop drinking on campus. Apparently the president has a drinking problem. This argument commits the fallacy of:",
    "options": ["A. Amphiboly", "B. Equivocation", "C. Composition", "D. Division"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The fallacy of amphiboly arises from an ambiguous grammatical structure in a sentence. The phrase \"stop drinking on campus\" can mean either the president will stop a drinking problem on campus, or the president will stop their own drinking problem while on campus. The argument makes a conclusion based on an ambiguous interpretation.",

The second person has said, no, death is not your sole alternative. In addition to freedom and death, there is slavery, which can be taken as third alternative. Thus, choose one of the three alternatives since they are only three. In this dialogue, the second person committed:",
    "options": ["A. No fallacy", "B. Missing the point fallacy", "C. Red herring fallacy", "D. False dichotomy fallacy"],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The first person presents a false dichotomy (\"freedom or death\"). The second person correctly identifies a third option but then commits their own false dichotomy by stating that these three are the \"only three alternatives,\" when other possibilities may exist.",

      'History provides education that help us understand ourselves in time'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The statement "History provides education that help us understand ourselves in time" is actually a core function of history. It is a subtle rephrasing of the other options, which all are correct uses of history. The question is poorly phrased, but based on the others, D is the intended incorrect answer.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'This proverb highlights the parallel between an individual\'s personal memories, which shape their identity, and a society\'s shared history, which shapes its collective identity.

      'All'

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'History is a multifaceted discipline that encompasses all three. It is the process of inquiry (the act of doing historical research), the interpretation (the story the historian tells), and the accumulated body of knowledge (the result of all past research) about the past.',

      'There is nothing unique about the discipline.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'While other disciplines study humanity or the environment, history\'s unique focus is on the temporal dimension. It is the only discipline that systematically studies and analyzes past human actions, events, and interactions with the environment to understand how and why things have changed over time.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'One of the most valuable uses of history is its ability to provide lessons from past events.

      'Oral tradition refers to recounting of the past across generations',
      'Oral tradition is used to verify lived experiences',
      'None of the above'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'While oral tradition can be a valuable source, it is not used to "verify lived experiences." Rather, it is a form of evidence itself. Verification is done by comparing different sources (including oral, written, and archaeological) against one another.',

      'Textbooks',
      'Coins'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'A primary source is a first-hand account or original material from a specific historical period. Textbooks are secondary sources because they are written by a historian who interprets and synthesizes information from primary sources.

      'They are “cooked” by historians',
      'None'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The term "cooked" implies that the source has been altered, interpreted, or synthesized, which is what historians do. A primary source is the raw, "uncooked" material. Historians use primary sources as their ingredients to create a historical narrative.',

    question: 'Secondary sources are more reliable than primary evidence.',
    options: ['True', 'False', 'All', 'None'],

        'None of the above'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A perfectly inelastic supply curve is a vertical line. This means that the quantity supplied does not change regardless of the price. If the perfectly elastic demand curve shifts up (to a higher price level), the new equilibrium will occur at the intersection of the new demand curve and the vertical supply curve. The result is a higher price and the same quantity supplied.',

    "options": [
      "Because the country's geology is very stable.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "An unconformity represents a gap in the geological record. The unconformity between the Precambrian and Mesozoic eras in Ethiopia is a major one because, after the formation of the Precambrian Basement Complex, there were long periods of uplift and erosion where no new rock was being deposited. This hiatus is reflected in the geological record as a missing sequence of rocks. .",

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Initially, the bell is a neutral stimulus because it doesn't naturally elicit salivation. Through its association with the food (the unconditioned stimulus), the bell becomes a conditioned stimulus. This means it has acquired the ability to trigger a learned response (salivation) on its own. The salivation in response to the bell is the conditioned response.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "An unconditioned stimulus (US) is a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without any prior learning. In Pavlov's experiment, the food is the US because it naturally causes the dogs to salivate. The salivation in response to the food is the unconditioned response (UR).",

This school of thought, pioneered by figures like Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, emphasizes an individual's free will, self-actualization, and their innate drive to reach their full potential. They believe that psychological problems can arise from a failure to find meaning or to achieve this potential. Psychoanalytic psychology would focus on unconscious conflicts, cognitive on thought patterns, and biological on genetics and brain chemistry.",

Functionalism focused on the purpose of mental processes, while behaviorism rejected introspection entirely and focused on observable behaviors.",

    "explanation": "Freudian psychodynamic theory primarily emphasizes the unconscious mind and the impact of early childhood experiences on personality. Freud believed that most human behavior is driven by unconscious desires, conflicts, and motivations, rather than conscious thought. Therefore, the role of the conscious mind is not the main focus of his theory.",

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Anthropology is a holistic field that encompasses both basic (or theoretical) and applied perspectives. While it generates knowledge about cultural and biological differences, its ultimate purpose often extends to applying this knowledge to address real-world issues. Applied anthropology uses data, theory, and methods to identify, assess, and solve contemporary societal problems.

Most anthropologists draw a line when practices, such as female genital mutilation or honor killings, cause physical or psychological harm and violate universal human rights.',

      'Craft artisans have scarcely important contributions; however, outsiders deserve high respect'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'This is the core paradox of craft workers in many parts of Ethiopia. They produce essential goods (e.g., tools, pottery, leather products) that are vital for the community\'s survival, yet they are often socially stigmatized, marginalized, and considered low in status by the very people who depend on their work.',

    correctAnswer: 5,
    explanation: 'All the factors listed—age, gender, ethnic identity, and occupation—are known to be significant factors in social marginalization in Ethiopia.
