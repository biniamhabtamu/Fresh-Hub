    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Ethiopia spans about 15¬∞ of longitude (east-west) and 12¬∞ of latitude (north-south). Therefore, its east-west extent is geographically longer than its north-south extent. (A) is incorrect because the one-hour time difference is due to longitudinal extension, not latitudinal. (B) is incorrect because the tropical climate is due to latitudinal position (near the equator), not longitude. (C) is incorrect; the east-west distance is 15¬∞.",

      "Requires a large army to protect its territory",
      "Difficult for effective administration",
      "Greater depth in mineral resources"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A larger territory increases the probability of having a wide variety and abundance of natural resources, including minerals, fertile land, and diverse ecosystems. This is a significant advantage or merit. The other options are disadvantages or challenges associated with a large size.",

      "The country owns wide arable land",
      "The country owns diverse cultures",
      "Defending external invasion",
      "Need for a large army"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A large country with long borders requires a large and costly military to defend its territory, which is a significant disadvantage. While \"defending external invasion\" (C) is a challenge, the \"need for a large army\" is the specific resource-based disadvantage. Options A and B are advantages.",

    "question": "The higher boundary length circle circumference ratio indicates the greater degree of compactness.",
    "options": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This statement is confusingly worded and incorrect. A higher degree of compactness means a shape is closer to a circle. For a given area, a circle has the shortest possible boundary (circumference). Therefore, a state with a lower boundary-to-area ratio is considered more compact, not higher.",

      "State 'B'",
      "Both are compact",
      "Both are not compact"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "We can use a simple ratio of Area / Boundary. A higher ratio indicates greater compactness. State A: 300,000 / 2,000 = 150. State B: 700,000 / 6,000 ‚âà 116.7. Since State A has a higher ratio, it is considered more compact.",

      "Kenya",
      "Somalia",
      "Eritrea"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Assuming this \"area-boundary\" figure is a compactness index, a higher number indicates a more compact shape. The question asks which is least compact (\"unlikely to have a compacted shape\"). Eritrea, with the lowest index value of 48.51, is the least compact of the group.",

    "options": [
      "The Simien Mountains were formed by volcanism and uplift, while the Rift Valley was formed by rifting and subsidence.",
      "The Simien Mountains were formed by compression, while the Rift Valley was formed by tension.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "While both are shaped by internal forces, their tectonic mechanisms are different. The Simien Mountains are part of the larger Ethiopian Highlands, which were formed by epeirogenic uplift and vast volcanic eruptions, primarily in the Cenozoic era. The Rift Valley, on the other hand, is a deep trough formed by tensional forces pulling the crust apart, leading to rifting and the downward movement (subsidence) of the land.",

    "question": "A dog learns to salivate at the sound of a bell because the bell was repeatedly paired with food. In this scenario, the sound of the bell is the:",
    "options": [
      "A. Unconditioned stimulus",
      "B. Neutral stimulus",
      "C. Conditioned stimulus",
      "D. Unconditioned response"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Initially, the bell is a neutral stimulus because it doesn't naturally elicit salivation. Through its association with the food (the unconditioned stimulus), the bell becomes a conditioned stimulus. This means it has acquired the ability to trigger a learned response (salivation) on its own. The salivation in response to the bell is the conditioned response.",

      "B. Unconditioned stimulus",
      "C. Neutral stimulus",
      "D. Conditioned response"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "An unconditioned stimulus (US) is a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without any prior learning. In Pavlov's experiment, the food is the US because it naturally causes the dogs to salivate. The salivation in response to the food is the unconditioned response (UR).",

      "C. Higher-order conditioning",
      "D. Stimulus generalization"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Stimulus generalization occurs when an organism responds to stimuli that are similar to the original conditioned stimulus. The child learned to fear the dentist's drill, and this fear generalized to a similar sound, the buzzer at the barbershop.",

      "C. Social cognition",
      "D. Complex problem-solving skills"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Classical conditioning deals with involuntary, reflexive responses (like salivating or blinking) that are learned through association. The organism doesn't consciously choose the response; it happens automatically. In contrast, voluntary behaviors are the focus of operant conditioning.",

      "C. Acquisition",
      "D. Stimulus discrimination"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Acquisition is the initial stage of learning in classical conditioning where a neutral stimulus begins to become a conditioned stimulus by being repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus. This is when the association is first established.",

      "D. Feeling happy when hearing a favorite song"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "An unconditioned response (UR) is an unlearned, natural reflexive reaction to an unconditioned stimulus (US). A puff of air hitting the eye is a US, and blinking is the UR. The other options are either conditioned responses (A, D) or a conditioned response (B). Salivating at the sight of food is an unconditioned response, but the prompt says a favorite food, which could imply a learned association, however, blinking is the most textbook example of an unconditioned response.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Initially, the police officer was a neutral stimulus. After being paired with a negative event (the speeding ticket, which is the unconditioned stimulus), the police officer becomes a conditioned stimulus that elicits a learned fear or crying response.",

Hagos wants to see if a relationship exists between social media use and academic performance, and a correlational study will allow him to determine the strength and direction of that relationship. An experimental method would be unsuitable as it would involve manipulating students' social media use, which is often not ethical or practical.

As one variable increases, the other decreases. Positive sign (+): Indicates a direct relationship. As one variable increases, the other also increases. The value (the number itself, ignoring the sign) indicates the strength. A value of -0.78 is a strong negative correlation, meaning as the number of class absences increases, final exam scores tend to decrease.",
